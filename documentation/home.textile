h1. What is play-httpmock ?

*play-httpmock* is a "play! framework":http://playframework.org module allowing you to cache a WebService response to overcome connection problems (lag, denial of service, HTTP errors) for fast developping.
So of course, it only concerns the DEV mode.

h1. Which play version to use ?

Due to anterior restriction, the module is only compatible with a recent play version (since "this commit":http://github.com/playframework/play/commit/1f2d8bfa632cb65383322fd45d26d2b9c487f934).

h1. How to use play-httpmock ?

You only need to import the module in your *application.conf*.

For example :
@module.httpmock=${play.path}/modules/httpmock@

After that, run your application in dev mode and go to */@httpmock* on your browser.
You will access the administration part of the module.

It's fairly straightforward :

h1. What is play-httpmock ?

*play-httpmock* is a "play! framework":http://playframework.org module which cache WebService requests to emulate them in order to overcome connection problems (lag, denial of service, HTTP errors) for fast developping.

Concretely, using this module, when you query an API (using .get() with the WS class) the response with be cached on your file system (commit the cache as a bootstrap could be a good idea) and next time you query the same request, it will use the cache instead of the WebService.
So all you have to do is recording all you need, and you don't need the webservice anymore for developping.

So of course, it only concerns the DEV mode.

h1. Which play version to use ?

The module is compatible with play 1.1 version (>= 1.1RC2).
